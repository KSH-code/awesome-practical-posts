open ai 매출이 벌써 연 2조라고 하네요.

- https://medium.com/idus-tech/kubernetes-pod-resources-cpu-limit-40626a4c235e

kubernetes의 cpu설정을 여러 케이스로 해서 개선하는 내용을 소개합니다.
레퍼런스들 까지 보면 도움이 많이 될 거 같아서 읽는 것을 추천합니다.

엔지니어링 비용을 원화로 환산하는데, 임팩트를 산출하는 과정이 인상적입니다.

마틴파울러 아저씨가 프롬프트 엔지니어링을 어떻게 하는지 설명하는 글입니다.
정답을 바로 알기 보다는, 문제 해결 과정을 같이 하는 것이 인상적이네요.

- [What Is MJIT in Ruby 2.6 & How Does It Work?](https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/11/ruby-mjit/)
  - It explains that MJIT is method based just in time compiler as simple.
  - [A look at how Ruby interprets your code](https://blog.appsignal.com/2017/08/01/ruby-magic-code-interpretation.html)
    - If you do not know about MJIT how it works, read this first. and you are into optimization, next up is [Tail Call Optimization in Ruby](https://nithinbekal.com/posts/ruby-tco/)
      - TCO is really intersting to me.
      - If you are intersted in algorithm problems, you may know TCO, is because stack overflow is occured in many recursion problems.
  - Get back to MJIT, Koichi Sasada's report is intersting "YARV: Yet Another RubyVM". I don't know its copyright so I just share the title.
  - Finally, we should know about MJIT. So what?
  - The real important thing is Ruby may not be used without any library such as Rails.
  - Ultimately, I was wondering if Ruby uses JIT, then RoR performance is better than that without JIT.
  - [Ruby 3 JIT can make Rails faster](https://k0kubun.medium.com/ruby-3-jit-can-make-rails-faster-756310f235a) Here is helper to solve my problem.
  - My conclusion is that we should not use RoR with JIT yet. Because it is unstable. However I think that metric of method usage would be better that it without JIT in the future.

- [Flaky Tests at Google and How We Mitigate Them](https://testing.googleblog.com/2016/05/flaky-tests-at-google-and-how-we.html)
  - Most of developers will probabaly be facing flaky test.
  - this is about google's story that how they migrate.
  - it is saying that system to monitor and for fast solve are important.
- [Test Flakiness - One of the main challenges of automated testing](https://testing.googleblog.com/2020/12/test-flakiness-one-of-main-challenges.html)
  - following post is saying about flaky causes.
- [Test Flakiness - One of the main challenges of automated testing (Part II)](https://testing.googleblog.com/2021/03/test-flakiness-one-of-main-challenges.html)
  - in now, last following post, is saying flaky causes.
  - how to solve that and suggest guidelines.

## 2021.04.08.

- [Beware of “service objects” in Rails](https://www.codewithjason.com/rails-service-objects/)
  - today, I did not read articles about GC. but I was interested in.
  - because I misbelieve service object in Rails, as you know too many classes created.
  - to break down fat model is good for readability. but too many files incur similar problems.
  - anyway, it says service object is not solution.
  - and include good links to understand background.
  - [Don't Create Objects That End With -ER](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/03/09/objects-end-with-er.html)
  - [AnemicDomainModel](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html)
    - I used to be hard to understand this. because of unfarmiliar terms.
    - but the point is like service object is bad one.
  - [Enough With the Service Objects Already](https://avdi.codes/service-objects/)
  - [Martin Fowler on Service Objects via the Ruby Rogues Parley mailing list](https://gist.github.com/blaix/5764401)
  - [How I code without service objects](https://www.codewithjason.com/code-without-service-objects/)
  - [What is a Rails model?](https://www.codewithjason.com/what-is-a-rails-model/)
  - too long, I can not sum-up.

## 2021.04.04.

- [Ruby Garbage Collection Deep Dive: Generational Garbage Collection](https://jemma.dev/blog/gc-generational)
  - Again, this is saying GC.
  - It explains GC generational such as young object and old object. I've not heared ever.
  - Anyway, that also include many terms be good.
  - I've understood what Minor GC is and Major GC is. However I want to know write barriers how actully works.
  - so I did surf using many terms to know it. and finally I found [Peter's Adventures in Ruby: Garbage Collection in Ruby](https://blog.peterzhu.ca/notes-on-ruby-gc/).
  - intersting! this explains a little about compaction and write barriers in detail. and also include another article [Incremental Garbage Collection in Ruby 2.2](https://blog.heroku.com/incremental-gc).
  - sum-up, the first article is to summerize about GC, and the second article explains GC in detail using GC and many figures. the final article explains.
  - the next step is reading [Copying Garbage Collection](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs312/2003fa/lectures/sec24.htm) and understanding ruby GC.start how works.

## 2021.03.22.

- [Ruby Garbage Collection Deep Dive: GC::INTERNAL_CONSTANTS](https://jemma.dev/blog/gc-internal)
  - Technically, I don't think it that is saying as deep. but it is helpful to understand how GC works in basic.
  - In this post, also has good link [Visualizing Your Ruby Heap](https://tenderlovemaking.com/2017/09/27/visualizing-your-ruby-heap.html).
    - It says Ruby is using page address and its position. it is same idea OS how to manage memory.
    - so I remind that I have learned about OS. and I realize why Ruby uses HEAP_PAGE_OBJ_LIMIT as 409.
  - Finally, I can read [Ruby Garbage Collection Deep Dive: Tri-Color Mark and Sweep](https://jemma.dev/blog/gc-mark-and-sweep).
  - so those are not actul helpful coding technique now. but I think that are helpful in the future when I learn new technique.

## 2021.03.05.

- [What does the other user using Ruby thinks of harder test](https://anthonysciamanna.com/2016/02/14/should-private-methods-be-tested.html)
  - Private method tested means to be complicated software and might be violated SRP. It says that to solve method is refactoring. But test would then be test still complicated. Hence says again that could be solved by stub or mock.
  - By the way, it may make following question. What are stub and mock? so is it appropriate solution? and in TDD can use that? does?
  - Martin Fowler(a.k.a Unkle Bob) introduces [what is the unit test?](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html) and differences between [classical testing and mockist testing](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html).
    - It is helpful to understand that to use mock and stub might be appropriate in TDD.
    - What I'm saying is that in tranditional TDD, test is only concerned about input and output. However to use stub and mock means that test code knows how such implemented. But mockist testing is allowed mock and stub in test code since unit test must be isolated.
    - So, How am I supposed to choose? my answer is that it depends on.

  - [Further article](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/3756a3fdfe8d339a53bf347487342f93fd9e1edb)
  - It does not post. but it is important to think what rails core developers' think.
  - And make a deep think predicate methods.
  - [Official Ruby FAQ](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/faq/6/)
    - However, this post says predicate methods can return true or false. so I'm confused now.
    - Finally, I've realized good to use predicate method'd be return only true and false because of usability and for documenting. as you know nil is unexpected value.
